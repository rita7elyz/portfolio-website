## Sundays are for kickball!

You could say this was an ordinary Sunday, but I would say it is **EXTRA**ordinary.  I have been resolving to get out of the house more often. Thank you, technology, for a little thing called MeetUp! It dragged my butt out the front door at 10:52am for an 11am kickball game with a local Nerd meet-up. My people!  I had never attended one of their gatherings before and they immediately made me feel welcome and put me on a team (the better one if I do say so myself. I mean come one, the other team was named “Baby Yoda Is Overrated”....).  I happily trotted to the outfield and proceeded to get my tennis shoes completely covered in mud over the next 2 hours. 

One thing I am constantly learning is that most strangers are awesome, cool people (except that jerk that cut me off on my way home haha!) But really. When I assume the best, I am generally met with it. It’s always worth putting yourself out there more times than it is not. Today was another reassurance of that. 

My afternoon led me to a comfy Starbucks where I unplugged from everything else and began to lose myself in my projects again. There is something beautiful about Sunday afternoon sun and the way it dances off the windows across the street and over to meet me. I’m pretty happy with this day.
