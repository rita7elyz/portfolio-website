## Happy Days in Quarantine

We are in the midst of being in quarantine due to Coronavirus and I wanted to share some things I have noticed since I began to work from home a week ago and California went to full shelter-in-place measures 3 days ago.

### People are more interactive outside of the house
Usually the only people who will wave hello or give me a smile and greeting when we pass in the streets are older folks. However, as the Coronavirus outbreak has spread more each day, I have noticed a definite shift in my community. When we walk along the street with our dog, most families that pass us will smile and give us a friendly “evening” or “hi”. We were able to go on a long hike this weekend and each person we past (with the exception of one couple who APPARENTLY didn’t get the memo) interacted with us! It was simple things like comments on how gorgeous our German Shepard is(he is) to sharing that there was a cute little snake up ahead on the trail. These kind of interactions are bizarre for our community and I can’t help but wonder and hope that they will stick just a little after this panic has passed.

### I am an introvert
I am a very outgoing person. Or so I thought. These last 7 days of solitude have been the biggest blessing I could have asked for. I forget that I am supposed to be crazy lonely.  Each day at 5pm when I log off work, I have so much energy for projects and to spend time with my wife. For quite a time, I have wished for a job in which I can work remote. This has shown me that my true introverted nature has long since been under-fed and that working remote truly would be a good fit for me. However, this “experiment” is skewed. Outside of this coronavirus bubble, I would be sure to cultivate social interactions away from my home. My current work situation, although fulfilling, leaves me socially drained every day. These last 7 days where I have had control over who “pops their head into my office” has left me feeling incredible peaceful and rested!

### I am more productive when I work remote
When I am happier, I work so much faster than normal. If I am sipping coffee on my patio, surrounded by flowers and hummingbirds I can do so much more in such a shorter span than while trapped in an office with no outside windows. I can also exercise on my breaks doing yoga or pullups without giving a second thought what my coworkers (currently my wife and my dog) think about me. This ability to move gives me more energy when I return to work. I love the feeling that I have control over the pace of my own work and I can work freaky fast when I am remote instead of in the office. 

These last few weeks have brought a lot of uncertainty to our lives. I do not know what these next few months will bring. If our isolation and social-distancing is practiced by the majority, hopefully it will bring nothing at all and this virus slowly disappears. In the meantime, I am enjoying the opportunity to notice some of the better parts of humanity and cozy-up with my wife in our home. Stay safe all.
