                        <p>My name is RaeMarie Donaldson and I am the happy Idahoan who has found herself
                             a new home in San Diego. I have loved working on computers for a long time 
                             but it was only recently that I realized the possibilities with programming.
                              I began my journey with a non-profit in downtown San Diego called SoftStack 
                              Factory and haven’t looked back. During the introduction class I realized I 
                              was hooked! I have worked in the insurance field for many years because it 
                              allowed me to problem solve on the daily and help people. Little did I know
                               how much of this and so much more was what was waiting for me in coding.
                                Everyone should get ridiculously excited about what they do daily. This is
                                 what I have discovered in programming and I’m so happy I’ve ended up exactly
                                  where I am. Come on my journey with me!
