This project really stretched me to **sharpen** my **problem solving techniques.**

## Overview 

I was excited when I learned we would have the opportunity to create an app using Ionic which would allow me to use the local functionality of a phone. When I began this project to practice using Ionic and Cordova, I originally started it as an app to take photos and store them. However, after an update to the Ionic version, the Cordova plugin no longer worked and it appeared no one else online was able to use the same plugin without some Python experience. Needless to say I was frustrated. I felt as though a significant amount of my time had been wasted on an app that no longer worked. 

However, as I am learning, rolling with new changes is just part of the landscape of coding. Deciding to make the best of it, I took my premade app and converted it to be a text-speaking app instead. I had already set up the backend to authenticate users and modified the front-end to take user text input and speak it along with having several premade phrases that the app would speak. The two most valuable concepts that were reinforced for me while working on this project was that you can never have too much practice setting up a working backend and that you must always be ready to adapt. 

## Key Concepts Learned:
* Ionic
* Cordova Plugins
* Backend set up

## Key TakeAways
1. Google is your best friend
2. Git Commit often, in case things don’t work later on
3. Adapt quickly 

I’m grateful to have tackled this app at the exact time that I did. Had I not encountered any obstacles, there wouldn’t have been so great an opportunity to continue to build my problem-solving muscle which I feel will better serve me in the future.
