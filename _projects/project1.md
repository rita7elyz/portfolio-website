This project really stretched me to **grow** my **communication skills.**
 
## Overview 

The culmination of our work in SoftStack Factory's Program was a group project creating an application for a local dueling piano bar. Working on this project was incredibly unique because during this time, everything was moved to remote due to Covid-19. There are many tools online for remote collaboration and this opened the door for us to fully utilize them in ways we wouldn't have had we been in class side by side. 

My portion of the application built out the advertising component which allows the bar owner to upload advertising content and select how often these will display and for how long. The owner can create and save multiple campaigns and assign the content and frequency of ad display to each.

My teammates' contribution takes that input and has it display in between showing a list of upcoming songs that the piano players will play. 

I really enjoyed this project because it forced me to reach out often and communicate very frequently to make up for the lack of physical proximity to my team. It also allowed me a great opportunity to take pride in a detailed contribution that was a necessary part of the whole while working under a deadline. It was enjoyable to think of what a business owner would want and create my contribution around that. 


## Key Concepts Learned:
* Angular
* Figma
* Material Design

## Key TakeAways
1. Team projects are most effective when there is clear and frequent communication.
2. The client is the most important player in this and the design should reflect that.


I really enjoyed building this application because it was the first experience I had working with a team on something big that stretched over several months.
