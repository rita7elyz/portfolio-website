## Overview 

This project was our final for the MEAN Stack course through SoftStack Factory but my work on it stretched long beyond our course. This application allows a user to create a profile which can be used to log into the app in the future. Once logged into, the user can search for movies by keyword and add them to their favorites. The user can then access their list of favorite movies and remove them if desired. 

I really enjoyed this project because it forced me to learn so many new concepts and practice them on a project I was very invested in. The biggest learning opportunities centered around utilizing apis and how to hide secure information when pushing to github. There was additional practice in setting up user authentication and a backend using relational models. It stretched my understanding of design as I had to find ways to make the app appearance pleasing to the eye. 

I really struggled to hide my sensitive information on this project like my api key. There are many resources online but none did exactly what I wanted. After much searching, I finally reached out to my former teacher with SoftStack Factory and he walked me through it successfully!

I have found many more things I would like to incorporate into this project as I have time. One thing I love about coding is that your creativity doesn't have to stop and the work can always continue.
