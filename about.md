My name is RaeMarie Donaldson and I am the happy Idahoan who has found herself a new home in San Diego. I have loved working on computers for a long time but it was only recently that I realized the possibilities with programming. I began my journey with a non-profit in downtown San Diego called SoftStack Factory and haven’t looked back. During the introduction class I realized I was hooked! I have worked in the insurance field for many years because it allowed me to problem solve on the daily and help people. Little did I know how much of this and so much more was what was waiting for me in coding. Everyone should get ridiculously excited about what they do daily. This is what I have discovered in programming and I’m so happy I’ve ended up exactly where I am. 

On a given weekend you will probably find me: 

* Camping.
* Surfing.
* Bingeing Futurama. Again.
* Working on a coding project.

Come on my journey with me! I can't wait to see what the Universe will bring.
